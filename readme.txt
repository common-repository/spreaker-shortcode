A simple and easy way to embed Spreaker player into your WordPress blog.


== Description ==

The Spreaker shortcode plugin is an easy way to embed Spreaker audio player into your WordPress blog. It works for any Spreaker episode, show, or user. Once you install this plugin, it will work on all of your blog posts.

A simple example:

`[spreaker type=player resource="episode_id=3331356"]`


**More Options**

Spreaker shortcode requires the resource play. It can be only of the following:

* `resource="episode_id=X"`: id of the episode to embed.
* `resource="show_id=X"`: id of the show, whose latest episode should be displayed.
* `resource="show_key=X"`: private key of the show to embed.

The plugin also supports the following optional parameters:

* `width`: player's width - can be in % or px (ie. `100%` or `400px`).
* `height`: player's height - can be in % or px (ie. `100%` or `400px`).
* `theme`: player's UI theme. Supported themes are: `light` (default) and `dark`.
* `color`: playerâ€™s main color. Supported fromats are short and long hex values (ie: `F00` or `FF0000`). This feature requires the podcast author to subscribe to [Station plan or above](https://www.spreaker.com/plans).
* `cover`: HTTPS url of an image to display as player's background.
* `playlist`:  configures how the playlist should be built. It can be `playlist="false"` to disable the playlist or `playlist="show"` to display all show's episodes in the playlist. The default behavious depends on resource. The playlist is visible only if the player height is greater than 200px.
* `playlist-continuous`: enables or disables the playlist continuous playback. When `true` it continuously plays all episodes in the playlist until the end.
* `playlist-loop`: enables or disables loop playlist playback when continuous playback is enabled. When `true` and playlist continuous playback is enabled as well, it will loop the playlist continuously (defaults to `false`).
* `playlist-autoupdate`: enables or disables the playlist autoupdate, when a new episode is published. This feature is enabled by default.
* `chapters-image`: enables or disables the display of chapters images in the player (defaults to `true`).
* `episode-image-position`: when `right` or `left` shows the episode image on the `right` or `left` (defaults to `right`)
* `hide-likes`: when `true` the likes button is not displayed in the player (defaults to `false`)
* `hide-comments`: when `true` the comments button is not displayed in the player (defaults to `false`)
* `hide-sharing`: when `true` the share button is not displayed in the player (defaults to `false`)
* `hide-logo`: when `true` the Spreaker logo is not displayed in the player (defaults to `false`). This feature requires the podcast author to subscribe to [Broadcaster plan or above](https://www.spreaker.com/plans).
* `hide-episode-description`: when `true` the button to open the description of the current episode is not displayed in the player (defaults to `false`)
* `hide-playlist-descriptions`: when `true` the button to open the description of episodes in the playlist is not displayed in the player (defaults to `false`)
* `hide-playlist-images`: when `true` the images of episodes in the playlist are not displayed in the player (defaults to `false`)
* `hide-download`: When `true`, it hides the episode download button (defaults to `true`)
